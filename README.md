------ GOAL ------

This project was created to help connect divers, in France and abroad and help there share, discover and document diving spots over time.

Internally, I decided to develop this platform to strengthen my competence using the MERN stack. 

------ TIMELINE ------

This project was initiated in early July 2020 and is due for completion by mid-September 2020


------ FEATURES ------

The first version of this project will focus on the essential, namely the search engine to discover spots nearby, filtered with keywords.

Anyone can add, edit and comment the diving spots on the platform.

The second version will include a feature enabling to share what fauna and flora was seen during the dive. We envision to generate useful data, over time, that can be used by marine research centers.

The final version (for now) will include a pairing engine that helps connect divers together so they can dive safely. The rule is: Never ever dive alone

------ ACCESS ------

The current version of the website is already accessible at: 
HOME -> https://master.d3iuqejqvw6pr6.amplifyapp.com 
SEARCH -> https://master.d3iuqejqvw6pr6.amplifyapp.com/search 
SPOT PAGE -> https://master.d3iuqejqvw6pr6.amplifyapp.com/result 

To this date, only the design and structure have been done. No logic is yet present. Do expect a very boring but good-looking website.
